Dependencies are controlled through [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

After cloning the repository, simply run `$ pipenv install` to get started.

## Running the notebook

A pipenv script starts the notebook in a virtual environment controlled by pipenv

```
$ pipenv run notebook
```

## Adding dependencies

For now, adding dependencies should be done through `pipenv`. Each dependency should be available to the notebook after having been set up.
